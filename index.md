### Hi my name is Andrei Cuprinsu and I am a second year PR student at buas.

### In here I'll will talk a bit about the reinforcement blog that will follow and my reasons for chosing to write about reinforcement learning. Feel free to jump straight to the blog if you want.

### So I wanted to start looking into reinforcement learning for quite a while and based on my current circumstances I decided that this will be a good time to look into it and then write something about it later. Due to the project that I was currently working with I decided to implement the reinforcement learning for C++ for better or worst. Looking back on my decision it might have been eassiers to do everything in python and just export the models after training to C++ but since I can't rewinde time I'll just move forward.

### The blog that will follow its mostly made from an implementation perspective for those that learn better through implementing rather than through theoretical knowledge. The only requirement for a better understanding would be some C++ knowledge and maybe some basic understanding about reinforcement learning algorithms in general. The blog will be built around some examples that I was working on and will showcase 2 reinforcement algorithms: Deep-Learning and DQN.

The following post will showcase and explain some of the environments that I created while also going a bit into how to desing a reward system.
