# Reinforcement Learning in C++ (Implementation focused)

## Introduction

As the name suggest this blog is about showcasing and explaining how you could use Reinforcement Learning with C++ while still comparing it to its python alternative and also briefly explaining some Reinforcement Learning concepts for a better understanding of the code. There will also be exaples of how you could build training environments and how a reward function for an environment will look but the explanations about why I did it like and what alternatives would there be will be keept to a minimum.

## What should you expect to learn from this blog?

After reading this blog and the associated materials you should be able to succesfully implement some form of Deep-Learning or DQN algorithms for C++, be able to set up pytorch for visual studio C++ projects and also be able to create your own environment or use some built by others.
